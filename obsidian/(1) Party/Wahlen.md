## Akenai of the Crafters

[[Wahlen]] made their way into town where [[Akenai Sachio]] greeted him and berated him for being late. After the events of the festival, [[Akenai Sachio|Akenai]] disappeared and no one around town seemed to know of an [[Akenai Sachio|Akenai]]. The only known information is that a [[Yokai]] lord shares her name and that she did not pass through [[Samni]]. 

After picking up a blade that was used for a ritual, [[Wahlen]] recovered a memory. [[Akenai Sachio|Akenai]] stood next to a man who was seemingly appealing to [[Terrada]] about a small shard of prismatic glass he held. After a small discussion they were denied. [[Terrada]] then addressed [[Wahlen]] saying that his trust was broken and the topic was supposed to stay between them.

## Hood and Hollow

During the slaughter of [[Ninnan Gate]], [[Wahlen]] saw a hooded figure for just a moment. Perhaps it was the trick of the light, but no one else seemed to notice him.
