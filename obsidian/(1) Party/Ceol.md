## The Guardian of the Taor

As the guardian walked out of the [[Taor]] ruin, the guardian's eyes stopped on [[Ceol]] and seemed to break free for just a moment, begging them to leave. [[Ceol]] then spoke to it in [[Dwarvish]] as he theorized it was a [[Dwarf]] based on its stature. It was able to have a few more moments of clarity, begging them to leave and saying he couldn’t stop, all words spoken in [[Dwarvish]]. It continued to follow them, though now at a much slower pace.
