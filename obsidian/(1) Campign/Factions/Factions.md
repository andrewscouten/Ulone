The Ikcho crafters

The name leaves no room for subtlety. They are crafters from Ikcho, often traveling to sell a new creation either of their own making, or an independent crafting organizations tool. Most are traders, but some are more than willing to pull out their tools and fight with them. 

The Shrine Maidens

Despite their name, not every shrine maiden is a woman. Shrine Maidens are worshippers of gods that tend to shrines of their chosen god. They often control the nature and elemental energies around them making them more than a shrine tender but also a guardian. 

The Sea Ronin

The Sea Ronin are often warriors who didn’t make the cut for Samurai but are still more than capable monster hunters and bounty hunters. They get their name by their ability to control water and use it as a tool for battle. A sea ronin can be the warrior that saves your life, village, or more. For a price. 

The Samurai

The Samurai are the main bringers of law to the land. They are well known by their armor and the mask of a demon they have tamed around their waist that they use in full control. It is seen as rude or even heresy to not address one as ‘Lord’ or ‘Lady’ as they have been granted power by the great Levin themselves. A Samurai’s word is final, and if that fails, its blade is truly the finale. 

The Helix dragons 

While not a true faction as they are recognized as a cult and are very small, the Helix dragons worship the Heili dragons and hunt the non divine dragons. Due to the dragons being a plague across the land, they take it upon themselves to kill it and feast on its flesh and bones. Some even claim that the more major parts of the dragon can alter their body giving them strange abilities. But they are all unfounded.
