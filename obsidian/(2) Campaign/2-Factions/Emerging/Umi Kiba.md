Also commonly known as ‘Maelstrom’. After the events of [[Ninnan Gate]], they rose from the seas attacking those on the coast without mercy. This faction is entirely made up of [[Triton]] but other [[Triton]] claim the [[Umi Kiba]] do not represent them and are a deviant group. Their tactics have found success along the coast and seek to find more as they unveiled their own [[Tekina]], specifically the one of [[Yuki-Onna]]. This would mark the first time in nearly fifty years that [[Yuki-Onna]] has appeared.
