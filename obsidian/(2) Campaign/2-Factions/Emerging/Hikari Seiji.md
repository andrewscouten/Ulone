The now rulers of [[Samni]] with their forces known as ‘Shinsei-Ban’ or ‘Dawnblades’ more casually. Their forces are led by [[Shino Korin Hikari]], Tekina of Komyoryu, warden of light. After their retreat to the land of Samni, they quickly established their rule with none to oppose them and established a new holy order once again worshipping Levin and the other gods. They have attempted many more plays for power since they certainly have the force to do so. But as of right now they have been unsuccessful other than their conquering of Samni.
