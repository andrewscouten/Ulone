Basically the complete opposite to the material plane. The immaterium. This is where people are believed to go when dying if they are not within the good graces of Levin. It’s Celestia, it’s Hell, it’s the Abyss, it’s the astral plane. Basically every plane in your standard D&D game other than the material plane. People don’t know shit about it other than when you Misty step, you go there, and that it’s bad.
