Named after the leaves that fall on the ground from the great Levin. Levin resides in the middle of this region and can even be seen over the whistling mountains. This is where the Samurai train fledglings and grant them their rights as rulers. Only the highest of nobility, and those who would become samurai are allowed to traverse on this golden land.Â
