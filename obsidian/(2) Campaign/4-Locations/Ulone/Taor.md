  - The Taor
---
While not necessarily a region itself, it is found in almost every region. The Taor are ancient ruins said to have existed before the war. No one knows who their inhabitants were, but some theorize they were much more advanced given that the stone that make these ruins have never been broken. Be that from human attempts and natural phenomena. Taor ruins are restricted to everyone other than the leaders of the region. Anyone else found trespassing will be given punishment.Â
