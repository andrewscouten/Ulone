Yatari is known as the region whose worship can be felt from miles away. They are undying to their gods and will use their religious fervor to harness magic. This is where most if not all shrine maidens come from. Some may call them fanatics to the missing Yatari or the gods themselves, but to claim they are ineffective in their ways is unfounded as you can see a shrine maiden in almost every town even outside Yatari.Â
