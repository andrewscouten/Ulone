# Region Summary

## [[Samni]] 

Samni is located in the middle of the continent. Trade is the main factor of the economy here and is often considered the richest region. It’s not uncommon to see common folk with silk clothing and having the pocket change to hire Sea Ronin. They hold almost every festival, big or small. 

## [[Ikcho]] 

Ikcho is often hailed as the land of creativity and is easily a hundred years ahead of every other region due to the creations they keep for themselves. They are responsible for almost every non rudimentary item or structure you see. 

## [[Yatari]]

Yatari is known as the region whose worship can be felt from miles away. They are undying to their gods and will use their religious fervor to harness magic. This is where most if not all shrine maidens come from. Some may call them fanatics to the missing Yatari or the gods themselves, but to claim they are ineffective in their ways is unfounded as you can see a shrine maiden in almost every town even outside Yatari. 

## [[Whistling Mountains|The Whistling Mountains]]

The largest mountain range in Ulone. It separates the land of leaves from the rest of the region. It’s mostly uninhabited other than non Heili dragons (Your standard European dragon), rumors of what should be long extinct Oni, and cult of the Helix dragons at the base. 

## [[Land of Leaves|The Land of Leaves]]

Named after the leaves that fall on the ground from the great Levin. Levin resides in the middle of this region and can even be seen over the whistling mountains. This is where the Samurai train fledglings and grant them their rights as rulers. Only the highest of nobility, and those who would become samurai are allowed to traverse on this golden land. 

## [[Taor|The Taor]]

While not necessarily a region itself, it is found in almost every region. The Taor are ancient ruins said to have existed before the war. No one knows who their inhabitants were, but some theorize they were much more advanced given that the stone that make these ruins have never been broken. Be that from human attempts and natural phenomena. Taor ruins are restricted to everyone other than the leaders of the region. Anyone else found trespassing will be given punishment.
