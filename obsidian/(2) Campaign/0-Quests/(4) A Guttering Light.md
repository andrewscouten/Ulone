# A Guttering Light

## Complete

The last thing that was seen was the party being pulled out of rubble. The only thing left living at [[Ninnan Gate]] seemingly. 

Fading in and out of deep slumber and being fed berries that nourished them while also keeping them in said deep slumber, the party found themselves in shackles on a cart. In the brief moments they awoke, they realized they each were in a cell, still shackled, and being questioned. Over many loops of falling into a slumber, awaking in a haze, and being questioned, the loop had finally ended. A small group consisting of Yari Talvec, Paragus and Barolt Kou, Enokaga Aritomi, and one other eluded to broke Ceol, Rui, and Wahlen out. After mentioning that Hera was also there, Paragus and Barolt went to find her ordering the others to leave. As they did so, they discovered they were in a mass industrial factory in Ikcho known as Imugi arcane works (I said Leviathan works but I forgot the name off the top of my head and I didn’t put it in my session notes. Ya boy he dumb)

As they continued on, alarm bells began to ring throughout the area and a Samurai tried to stop them. Yari told them to leave and the last the party saw of Yari was him against the samurai in a very one sided battle not in his favor. 

The party finally reached their escape route which was an unfinished mining tunnel. They began to drive a large cart down the tunnel, the four fending off pursuers and eventually a large construct. Unable to stop the cart, it ran off an incomplete rail way, tumbling into rapids below.
