# A Chance Encounter

## Ongoing

As the party has joined house Liotus heading Northward, winter draws ever closer. They are still a minimum of a three month travel from the border without weather delays. 

As winter came full force to the traveling caravan, they were significantly slowed down. As time went on, more and more people started going missing from the caravan until the remnants of the group were encountered by a small group of yokai. The party vanquished them leaving them as the only survivors of the caravan. On the yokai were simple instructions. ‘Bring me Wahlen and Ceol, signed, your lord’. 

They then went to the Aclassi estate where Serai asked Hera to attend a meeting in Ironblossom keep to see why her father was invited. Now they travel, hopefully to avoid the oncoming skirmish which could possibly start the first declaration of war after Ulone’s death.
