## Completed

As the party was hired by the [[House Shuki|Shuki Family]], it was revealed that [[Akaza]] is the [[Akaza|Tekina of Fire]] and has not yet been able to transform into [[Ryu]]. But as the threat of a sub section of [[Yatari]] moving towards [[Samni]], [[Ryu]] is needed if [[Samni]] is to face the might of an opposing [[Aikon]]. 

The night before [[Akaza]] was to enter a [[Taor]] ruin to hopefully complete his transformation. [[Ninnan Gate]] was attacked by a group that bore colors from the [[Land of Leaves]]. The party managed to repel the small attacking force including a [[Gakus Tank Samurai]], which they were able to find some had infiltrated their ranks. [[Shiori]] tried to warn [[Akibara Shuki|Akibara]] and [[Akaza]] too late. [[Akibara Shuki|Akibara]] was slain and [[Akaza]] embodied the form of [[Ryu]], disintegrating [[Shiori]] in the process. While this happened, the party got a splitting headache causing them to fall to the ground where they were able to see a man in front of them catch on fire and burn into the form of a [[Yamakaen|Second Aikon of Fire]] leading to the death of [[Ryu]]. That night, [[Ninnan Gate]] and [[Samni]] fell.
