# I Bid That Flames Return

## Completed

As the party was hired by the Shuki family, it was revealed that Akaza is the Tekina of fire and has not yet been able to transform into Ryu. But as the threat of a sub section of Yatari moving towards Samni, Ryu is needed if Samni is to face the might of an opposing Aikon.Â 

The night before Akaza was to enter a Taor ruin to hopefully complete his transformation. Ninnan gate was attacked by a group that bore colors from the land of leaves. The party managed to repel the small attacking force including a Gakus tank Samurai, which they were able to find some had infiltrated their ranks. Shiori tried to warn Akibari and Akaza too late. Akibara was slain and Akaza embodied the form of Ryu, disintegrating Shiori in the process. While this happened, the party got a splitting headache causing them to fall to the ground where they were able to see a man in front of them catch on fire and burn into the form of a second Aikon of fire leading to the death of Ryu. That night, Ninnan gate and Samni fell.
