At last. A celebration of spring is no longer held in the capital of [[Samni]]. [[Saohun]] has been permitted to hold a small festival in the town and all around the area have been given the opportunity to attend. For whatever reason, you have come here as well. Be it to buy from traders, sell to the mass foot traffic, or just experience the majesty of Spring’s rise.
