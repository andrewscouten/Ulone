This name is given to the mutant races or ones that naturally have magic, excluding Yuan-ti and Triton, 

They are also known as the ‘slave race’ or ‘Marked’ as they are property for the superior races. Ink is cast on their face to mark them, removal of this brand carries the possibility of death as poison can leak into veins. Buying a new bearer is commonplace, but the bearers who are able to fight cost quite a good amount. 

Attempting to remove their brand is punishable by death for the bearer and anyone involved.
