Similar to bearers, the Tekina are born magical but are given special privileges as it is said that the power of Ulone or one of his children flows through them.

“And behold, eight wardens of my power. Fire, Earth, Water, Ice, Light, Darkness, Wind, and Lightning.” -Ulone, champion of Levin

The Tekina are often assumed to be warriors of great renown, some even being able to turn into large creatures known as ‘Aikons’. Some speculate that these Aikon’s are the Heili dragons, but they are only rumors. 

Current known Aikons:
Tengu: The breath of wind 
Orochi: The Lord of Lightning
Ryu: The Flying flame 
Yuki-onna: The Warden of Ice 
Namazu: The lost 
Tsuchigomo: The Earthshaker
