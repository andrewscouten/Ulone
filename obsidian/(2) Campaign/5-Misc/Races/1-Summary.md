# The Races

The following is the list of races that currently exist in Ulone. Some of them are not races but rather a large generalized group. 

## Common

### [[Humans]]

The most common species in Ulone, therefore most samurai and higher individuals are human. Overall they have a very neutral standing with people as they never did anything world changing in the war. 

### [[Dwarves]]

The second most common race. However unlike humans they are often revered due to simply being the same race as Ulone. They might even get a pass for not addressing a samurai as ‘lord’ or ‘lady’. 

### [[Yuan-Ti]]

The last of the common races and have a general attracting aura around them. They are quick to make friends, possibly because their scales resemble that of the Heili dragon’s. But make no mistake, they were seen as one of, if not the greatest fighters in the war. 

## Uncommon

### [[Half Elves]]

The start of the less common races, half elves are spared persecution due to their ancestors switching sides in the Great War. But they are on a very thin line. It’s not uncommon for them to be refused service. Just penance for their ancestors' actions. 

### [[Halfling]]

One of the newer races, it is said that Levin took the holy parts of the Dwarves to create a new race fit. These are rather uncommon but often have kind souls and generally fit right in with Dwarves. 

### [[Dragonborn]]

Said to be an offshoot of the Yuan-Ti, Dragonborn are incredibly rare and are rumored to be fallen scales from the Heili dragons. No one has confirmed if this is true, but as of right now, it’s treated as fact. 

### [[Tabaxi]]

Also known as ‘Noyona’, they are a race of felines, sometimes having only cat eyes and other times looking entirely like a cat. They are the oldest of the more uncommon races as it is said that Ulone created them. There are even some rumors that one was his wife. 

### [[Triton]]

While hailing from the sea, they are not all necessarily sea ronin but do come with the innate power to command water and are the one race aside from Yuan-ti that are given the magical exemption. They are the youngest of the new races and it’s not rare to see one as a bodyguard. 

### [[Bearers]]

This name is given to the mutant races or ones that naturally have magic, excluding Yuan-ti and Triton, 

They are also known as the ‘slave race’ or ‘Marked’ as they are property for the superior races. Ink is cast on their face to mark them, removal of this brand carries the possibility of death as poison can leak into veins. Buying a new bearer is commonplace, but the bearers who are able to fight cost quite a good amount. 

Attempting to remove their brand is punishable by death for the bearer and anyone involved. 

### [[Tekina]]

Similar to bearers, the Tekina are born magical but are given special privileges as it is said that the power of Ulone or one of his children flows through them.

“And behold, eight wardens of my power. Fire, Earth, Water, Ice, Light, Darkness, Wind, and Lightning.” -Ulone, champion of Levin

The Tekina are often assumed to be warriors of great renown, some even being able to turn into large creatures known as ‘Aikons’. Some speculate that these Aikon’s are the Heili dragons, but they are only rumors. 

Current known Aikons:
Tengu: The breath of wind 
Orochi: The Lord of Lightning
Ryu: The Flying flame 
Yuki-onna: The Warden of Ice 
Namazu: The lost 
Tsuchigomo: The Earthshaker 
Amanozako: The eversetting 
Komyoryu: The blinding
