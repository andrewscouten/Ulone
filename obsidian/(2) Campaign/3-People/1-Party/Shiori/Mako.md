[[Shiori]]'s brother
Is a [[Sea Ronin]]
Silver white hair

## Missing, Assumed Deceased

The white haired son of the Shuki family. His long white hair often is seen going down to his middle back covering most of the back of his light blue haori. His tanned skin and blue eyes match with his clothing but contrast against his hair. He often carries two odachi sized cleaver sabers that are connected by a long chain. 

Before their disbandment, he was the Sea Ronin’s third in command but had only ever led one mission.  He was his brother's shield, promising to protect the blessing he had and his family forevermore. As the second Aikon of Fire appeared, he was consumed by its flame leaving his fate unknown, as a body was never found at Ninnan gate.
