# Yari Talvec

## Alive

A Yuan-Ti man that hardly looks old enough to drink. Bits of golden scales around his neck, cheeks, and forearms match his striking golden blonde hair. He’s built rather stocky compared to the average person of his race but is also significantly shorter standing at five foot four. He is always seen with his chokuo at his hip, sheathed in a saya of golden emblems from the Talvec clan.

After the death of his grandfather, he was thrust into the position of leadership of Saohun and the clan despite only being a fledgling. He is now possibly marked a traitor for his organization of the Imugi arcane works infiltration.
