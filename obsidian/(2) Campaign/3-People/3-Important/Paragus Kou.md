# Paragus Kou 

## Appearance

A human in his late 40’s with short black hair and a slender build. Scars layer his fingers that are mostly covered in bronze rings. His eyes have a seemingly yellow and slit like look to them that contrasts against his dark layered robes. 

## About

He was revealed to be the vessel for the [[Dragon of Spring]] and current outlaw in most regions due to his freeing of bearers to conduct research for his son. 

He was previously the Lord Taisho of Yatari (essentially high commander) before he betrayed the emperor, [[Arasuda Tenbatsu]], and his previous wife, [[Kazera]]: [[Kazera|Tekina of the Wind]]
