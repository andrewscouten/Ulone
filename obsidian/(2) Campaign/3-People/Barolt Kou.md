## Alive

A young man wearing a furred wolf head that seems to be stitched at the neck. A large brand is upon his chest that’s easily seen as he is shirtless and the rest of his body is sported with ragged black clothing. 

He is nothing short of feral, wearing a collar that seemingly controls the fits of ferocity.
