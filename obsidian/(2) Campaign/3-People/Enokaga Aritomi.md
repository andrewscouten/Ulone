Bearer from [[Saohun]], owns a gator

# Enokaga Aritomi

## Alive

Fair, lady-like, graceful, and charming are words used to directly contrast what Enokaga is. She is a massive bovine abhuman bearer standing at six foot five without her horns with a muscular build of an overworked farmer and warrior. Her greasy and messy blonde hair with splotches of black matches the brown ragged clothing typical for a bearer. Her native magic seems to be that of stone. 

Side note: Literally everyone forgets her name until I say ‘Gator lady’.
