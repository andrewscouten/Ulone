We go towards a town of [[Bulga]]...
- **EXPLOSION** in the distance in the town
- The people we see in the town are the [[Hikari Seiji]], the current people in charge in [[Samni]]. They look around, a large person holding a barrel commanding "Kill them!"
- 3 people left, one of whom is [[Hinatsuru Shuki]]

There is a letter attached to a [[Shard]]...
- Seems like you've got yourself a new friend! No worries, there's plenty of your gift to go around, if you have the will for it at least. After all, the zealots just needed a little push to come here. Consider this one on the house. Hope to work together again soon.
- [[Hera]] gives the shard to [[Wahlen]] and after a long drawn out process, [[Wahlen]] tells the group some answers
- The [[Shard]] goes into book and helps [[Praxis]]
- [[Rui]] and [[Ceol]] sleep separately, [[Rui]] goes to the [[Suteki]] with [[Terrada]]. [[Terrada]] did not want us to keep exploring the [[Taor]] ruins
- [[Ganra Dokugan|Ganra]] has a disagreement with the [[Kagenami]]. [[Ganra Dokugan|Ganra]] went north with a section of the [[Kagenami]], the split faction in the [[Kagenami]] went south

We plan with [[Paragus Kou|Paragus]] to attack the capital of [[Ikcho]]
- [[Yari Talvec|Yari]] will not come with us but [[Macko]] will
