We are on our back way to the [[Hideaway]]...
- [[Paragus Kou|Paragus]] sends a message
- [[Ceol]] hears a soft crunching of bones, looking up at ~20 [[Shokari]]
	- Your need help? Ride. Trade. Meat. Small. From bodies. For the hunt.
	- Upon eating [[Wahlen]]... "Old. Older than [[Shokari]]."
	- We get on their horses with ape hands and horns and ride

---
[[Praxis]] gets a note from [[Paragus Kou|Paragus]]: "I have found something I can't explain. Please come help." [[Praxis]] makes his way there....

[[Wahlen]] is in a makeshift dungeon dreaming...
- In the shower, water cold. Speaker translates as words come through announcing my arrival. "Fire fox, fire fox"... meaning you are needed in the cockpit
- In the cockpit there is crystals with projections of status. [[Terrada]] is on the helm, high alert with fox-like features; [[Oharah]] is holding their blade tapping their foot. Projection in front of [[Terrada]], 6 crystals with names of the [[Aikon|Akions]]. [[Tengu]] and [[Ryu]] are down.
- Blob of flesh, metal, and stone... 2 crystals on it: [[Yamakaen]], [[Okami]]
- [[Tsuchigomo]] has been eliminated, [[Yuki-onna]] has been eliminated... cooling systems offline... all [[Aikon|Akions]] go offline... [[Okami]] online
- We get to the escape pods, jet out, ship destroyed, among the stars
- Dream cuts to current [[Ulone (Land)]], hard to breathe, massive blade in kidney, poison going through body, [[Akenai Sachio|Akenai]] is trying to heal [[Wahlen]]. [[Oharah]] runs towards [[Wahlen]], stabbing a shard into his heart... [[Oharah]] does an operation, dropping part of [[Wahlen]]'s heart on the ground. [[Oharah]] grabs the half of heart and the memory ends

[[Wahlen]] and [[Hera]] switch dreams...
- [[Wahlen]] is no longer in their body... in [[Hera]]'s body, she's training with her father. This is a nice memory of [[Hera]]'s training... Memory cuts to her and [[Serai]] studying with a book open on the desk, mouth agape... This is a big betrayal. [[Serai]] says nothing to deny it. [[Hera]] grabs her blade and runs out of the estate.
- As [[Hera]] dreams weird dreams before her dreams are interrupted, her mind reeling. She is in the [[Suteki]]. [[Terrada]] is in front her her, long 9 tails, 2 large fox ears, looking aside and seeing a split rift of reality. [[Ulone]] is standing next to him, a root of [[Levin]] in his hand. Everyone is frozen in place, terrified. [[Terrada]] is looking [[Ulone]] down. "Run. Both of you. Run. Run as fast as you can." [[Ulone]] lunges at [[Wahlen]] before [[Terrada]] intercepts. A MASSIVE battle erupts. It sounds like [[Terrada]] is losing.
- [[Hera]] wakes up screaming before she stops.. She's not breathing. She's dying.

---
At the [[Hideaway]]...
- [[Ceol]] repairs armor and weapons, removing the sigil of [[Samni]] on [[Macko]]'s armor
- [[Rui]] gets pulled aside by [[Yari Talvec|Yari]]
	- You do know you're traveling with... *motions to [[Hera]]*
	- [[Hera]]'s family is a HUGE deal

---
[[Praxis]] gets ambushed by a tripwire, getting captured by the [[Hikari Seiji]]...
- Two cloaked figures save him, the two [[Samurai]] captors running away
- One is abhuman (silver hair, horns) and one sets some captors on fire (black hair)
- "You will release him... or you will die."

[[Macko]] and [[Wahlen]] have a heated aside...

[[Praxis]] slides into the group...
- Mad at [[Paragus Kou|Paragus]]
- Being chased by [[Hikari Seiji]], we have to fight!

[[Tsuga Kitakuri]] has a message for [[Hera]]
- They would like to apologize for the events leading up to [[Imugi Arcaneworks]], it should not have happened
- [[Hera]]'s father wishes for her to return to the capital of [[Ikcho]], this is not a demand but a request. "Repair things between each other" *[[Hera]] laughs and declines.*
- There is a high chance that [[Tsuga Kitakuri]] is sent to hunt [[Hera]] down if she does not come. Next time he will be aiming to kill her

[[Enokaga Aritomi|Enokaga]] recaps...
- There is another [[Ryu|Tekina of Fire]] ? Maybe [[Akaza]] is alive?
- We need to intercept people at [[Ninnan Gate]]

---
We arrive at a town named [[Bulga]], [[Samni]]i...
- Someone is looking for [[Rui]] and sees the rest of us...[[Hinatsuru Shuki]] invites us to their home
- There is some blue flashes of light happening at [[Ninnan Gate]], a blue like the [[Guardian]] left
- Those who pray every day... the emperor says they should die 
- 2nd [[Aikon]] of fire will emerge from the [[Taor]] ruins at [[Ninnan Gate]] to fight [[Ryu]]?
