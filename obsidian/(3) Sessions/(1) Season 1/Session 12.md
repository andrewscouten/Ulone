We are on our back way to the [[Hideaway]]...
- [[Paragus Kou|Paragus]] sends a message
- [[Ceol]] hears a soft crunching of bones, looking up at ~20 [[Shokari]]
	- Your need help? Ride. Trade. Meat. Small. From bodies. For the hunt.
	- Upon eating [[Wahlen]]... "Old. Older than [[Shokari]]."
	- We get on their horses with ape hands and horns and ride

[[Praxis]] gets a note from [[Paragus Kou|Paragus]]: "I have found something I can't explain. Please come help." [[Praxis]] makes his way there....

[[Wahlen]] is in a makeshift dungeon dreaming...
- In the shower, water cold. Speaker translates as words come through announcing my arrival. "Fire fox, fire fox"... meaning you are needed in the cockpit
- In the cockpit there is crystals with projections of status. [[Terrada]] is on the helm, high alert with fox-like features; [[Oharah]] is holding their blade tapping their foot. Projection in front of [[Terrada]], 6 crystals with names of the [[Akion|Akions]]. [[Tengu]] and [[Ryu]] are down.
- Blob of flesh, metal, and stone... 2 crystals on it: Yamakain, Yokami
- [[Tsuchigomo]] has been eliminated, [[Yuki-onna]] has been eliminated... cooling systems offline... all [[Akion|Akions]] go offline... [[Okami]] online
- We get to the escape pods, jet out, ship destroyed, among the stars
- Dream cuts to current [[(2) Campaign/4-Locations/Ulone/Ulone]], hard to breathe, massive blade in kidney, poison going through body, [[Akenai Sachio|Akenai]] is trying to heal [[Wahlen]]. [[Oharah]] runs towards [[Wahlen]], stabbing a shard into his heart... [[Oharah]] does an operation, dropping part of [[Wahlen]]'s heart on the ground. [[Oharah]] grabs the half of heart and the memory ends

[[Wahlen]] and [[Hera]] switch dreams...
- [[Wahlen]] is no longer in their body... in [[Hera]]'s body, she's training with her father. This is a nice memory of [[Hera]]'s training... Memory cuts to her and [[Serai]] studying with a book open on the desk, mouth agape... This is a big betrayal. [[Serai]] says nothing to deny it. [[Hera]] grabs her blade and runs out of the estate.
- As [[Hera]] dreams weird dreams before her dreams are interrupted, her mind reeling. She is in the [[Suteki]]. [[Terrada]] is in front her her, long 9 tails, 2 large fox ears, looking aside and seeing a split rift of reality. [[(2) Campaign/1-Entities/Ulone]] is standing next to him, a root of [[Levin]] in his hand. Everyone is frozen in place, terrified. [[Terrada]] is looking [[(2) Campaign/1-Entities/Ulone]] down. "Run. Both of you. Run. Run as fast as you can." [[(2) Campaign/1-Entities/Ulone]] lunges at [[Wahlen]] before [[Terrada]] intercepts. A MASSIVE battle erupts. It sounds like [[Terrada]] is losing.
- [[Hera]] wakes up screaming before she stops.. She's not breathing. She's dying.

At the [[Hideaway]]...
- [[Ceol]] repairs armor and weapons, removing the sigil of [[Samni]] on [[Mako]]'s armor
- [[Rui]] gets pulled aside by [[Yari Talvec|Yari]]... "You do know you're traveling with... *motions to [[Hera]]*".
