- We fight the [[Guardian]]...
	- The group wounds it, the wounds are covered in pipes and tubes that magically reconnect (even with distance). It's only a matter of time before it comes back
	- [[Wahlen]] feeds it blood, and it reanimates... oops

- See a man in whiteish black armor running past...
	- He's an honor guard from [[Yatari]], we follow him
	- [[Hera]] recognizes [[Kazera]], the [[Kazera|Tekina of the Wind]]
