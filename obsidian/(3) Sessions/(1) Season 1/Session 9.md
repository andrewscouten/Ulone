Party headed towards [[Iron Blossom Keep]]...
- The land looks like a desert, which is wrong... It should be lush this time of year
- [[Himoto]] was claimed to be busy
- [[Ganra|Ganra Dokugan]], [[Tekina]] of [[Tsuchigomo]], greets us, trusting that [[Hera]] would be safe

---
[[Wahlen]] feels the book give him a message...

--- 
[[Hera]] talks with [[Ganra|Ganra Dokugan]]...
- She is given a magic crystal that shoots out a beam, normal people can use it, it doesn't feel limited... It's a part of a [[Taor]] ruin
	- [[Himoto]], [[Hera]]'s father, is in charge of this enterprise. But he has not gotten his daughters involved
	- It is "in the works" that this power could be used on a larger scale (mega death star vibes)
	- [[Hera]] gets a crystal, giving her eldritch blast for free?!

[[Hera]] and [[Ganra]] enter the summit...
- People are already arguing: [[Gunshi Kage]] (military strategist, old man), Arbiter Abidia [[Hashin]], Second Gunshi Arubia (Ikcho)
- Not a peace treaty deal, too many military people... People are arguing, some promised people in battle but not delivering, more and more arguing
- As the screaming dies down, a woman speaks up
	- [[Dwarves]] of [[Ikcho]] drove back enemies in the first war
- [[Ganra]] warns us to LEAVE, there will be a battle
- [[Khazera]], "The Breath of Wind", states that [[Ganra]] is going to hunt "The Snow Queen" now

---
A full battle breaks out, [[Ikcho]] getting pushed back...
- As the party is leaving, 3 bearers ambush us... They wear armor of [[Yatari]], they are trying to escort people out of battle 
- 3 [[Bearers]] from the [[Hikari Seiji]]
	- 2 large blades, [[Wyvern]]
	- [[Biyast]], in charge
	- Light on feet, short blade, [[Avis]]

A giant hand comes out from the ground, [[Tsuchigomo]]
- A small crystal forms in the sky as a blizzard comes, a catlike [[Yuki-onna]] bursting from the crystal
- Cannons from [[Ikcho]] fire at the [[Yuki-onna]], [[Tsuchigomo]] approaching... Two [[Akion]] fight, an event that has only happened once in history

We fall, running from the battle of [[Akion]]s
- [[Hera]] and [[Rui]] fall behind, the [[Yuki-onna]] hovering above them... They dodge the ice shards before running through the footprints of [[Tsuchigomo]]
- [[Ceol]] and [[Hera]] fall and become unconscious
- [[Wyvern]] heals everyone 

--- 
We fight the [[Tekina]] of [[Yuki-onna]], trying to flee from battle...
- [[Rui]] seems to have a connection to the [[Yuki-onna]], wanting us to stop fighting but we don't
- We kill the [[Tekina]] of the [[Yuki-onna]], [[Rui]]'s head getting grabbed beforehand and information being transferred... She screams, recoiling in pain
- [[Mako]] is here, aka [[Wyvern]]... He defends us against the other two bearers

Greenish orange dragon saves us from reinforcements...
- A man on all fours walks out... [[Paragus Kou]] also joins us...
- Throws a crystal like [[Hera]] had and a portal opens up

---
We arrive at a place that a lot of people have gathered, lot of bearers
- [[Yari Talvec|Yari]] is here, half of his face gnashed; he takes [[Rui]]'s pain away with his lineage's ability
- We are between [[Ikcho]], [[Yatari]], and [[Samni]], a small area below the border

[[Paragus Kou]] meets with the party...
- [[Wahlen]] tells him about the dream
- [[Ceol]] recounts that 2 icons of the same element is unheard of, he fought in a war with [[Ulone]]
- [[Ganra]] is mentioned, maybe they are working with them, the [[Tekina]] of the [[Kagenami]]
- [Hera]] asks about [[Paragus Kou]]... 
	- [[Paragus Kou]] is a fugitive from [[Yatari]], [[Samni]], and [[Ikcho]] and the [[Kagenami]]
	- He wants to understand the [[Veylflood]]s and get peace to [[Bearers]]
	- He walked into a [[Veylflood]] and was unharmed... due to a [[Helix Dragon]]... he is the spring dragon...
- [[Rui]]'s turn...
	- His son became a [[Veyllost]]

[[Shiori]] of the shadowstriders
"Don't trust... It eats gods"

--- 
[[Akenai Sachio|Akenai]] does not officialy exist, but the ruler of what [[Yatari]] is now, [[Timbatzu Azuna]] the ruler, were affiliated... After investigating, [[Paragus Kou]] is no longer allowed in [[Yatari]]. They were doing something with the [[Taor]] ruins
- 2nd [[Akion]] of fire right outside of a [[Taor]] ruin
- [[Iron works]] is making crystals made out of [[Taor]] ruins

[[Akion]] of fire fighting a red-aired man made of steel, land splits in half, [[Timbatzu Azuna]] WASN'T ALWAYS A [[Tekina]], they sacrificed many [[Oni]]
