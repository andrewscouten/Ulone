# Session 2

---
- The party has a morning greeting to one another in the barn they were staying in...
	- [[Shiori]] is awoken my [[Mako]]. [[Mako]] is excited about their new job! 
	- [[Shiori]] is worried about [[Akaza]], saying he must prove himself before he can join us... "If you can control your powers you can come."
	- [[Ceol]] has a tea ritual almost every morning, offers everyone some
	- [[Ceol]] points out that [[Shiori]] is the sister to the heir to the throne... [[Akaza]]?
	- [[Ceol]] was in the war of the [[Great Shattering]], ~200-300 years ago
	- [[Rui]] is from [[Ikcho]]. [[Mako]] notes that a lot of radical [[Yatari|Yatarians]] fight with a similar flowery dance style

---
- The party sets out to the shrine...
	- A LOT of dead birds belly up on the road, as if fallen out of their air. No sickness. Necromancy magic
	- Guarded, something wrong inside, another [[Shrine Maidens|Shrine Maiden]] went inside to protect [[Lleth]]
	- Somethings feels off, we fight
	- LOOT: 1x yellow and 1x green talisman

---
- Inside the shrine...
	- Everything is destroyed and looks discredited. The shrine maiden is tied to a chair, hood over head, talismans on body
	- Dude with face of pug, looks like a bear, hooves, named [[Ghomah]] (?)
		- "Tell [[Oharah]] I said go fuck himself!" - he poofs away and we hear shuffling away
		- He smashes a yellow and green talisman together, a grey area forming before he jumps in, looks like the [[Suteki]]
- We smash the talismans the same way
	- Silver hair going to hips, fox hair ears, Sephiroth with less aura
	- Guy with red hair
	- Same bear guy there
- He assumes we are with [[Oharah]]. We ask who that is
	- [[Oharah]] is responsible for the festival and [[Lleth]] by letting the [[Suteki]] into her mind... They were trying to "help" Lleth
	- Kitsune - [[Terrada]], current king of [[Yokai]], [[Oharah]] is a rebellious youth who has gathered a lot of support... We are in the realm of [[Suteki]]
	- The talismans are "a being made manifest" that can extract the [[Suteki]] influence
	- [[Levin]] stops [[Terrada]] from coming to the mortal plane... [[Levin]] didn't appreciate what they did in the [[Great War]]
- Why did [[Oharah]] attack the festival?
	- He opens a window showing a giant forest, where there are bunch of creatures fighting and regenerating... "Without consumption of people we go rabid...." [[Oharah]] blames him for this... Each [[Yokai]] needs to eat different parts of a human in order to live... Some blood, some flesh, etc.
- Two icons have awakened in [[Yatari]], [[Amanozako]] and [[Komyoryu]], darkness and lightness
- Two entities clashed, one on a horse of darkness and a blade, the other is flying and is in the form of a dragon
- [[Wahlen]]'s book is like [[Zhokan]]'s book
- [[Mako]] and [[Shiori]]
	- They've gone without the summer dragon for 19 years already.... The boy ([[Akaza]]) needs to become a man
	- [[Mako]] hasn't been allowed to go out on missions by his father... He wants to be ready badly
- Tensions rise, [[Samni]] will prepare for a skirmish, [[Oharah]] would take root there
