[[Wahlen]] is passed out
- Grayscale, on a beach, giving 2 crystals to [[Oharah]]. A small cat-like girl, very young (5 max), that's [[Akenai Sachio|Akenai]]... A same age man, probably red-ish hair (deep crimson, not like [[Ceol]]). [[Oharah]] puts a crystal in his pocket, the other one he holds... A wolf symbol with 9 tails on it.... "I am not sure what to do with this one...".... Cut to [[Oharah]] and [[Akenai Sachio|Akenai]] hovering over me. [[Oharah]] is holding half of [[Wahlen]]'s heart over him.... A silver haired man on the floor, head ripped off and dead. 2 women by the side, one badly wounded, one missing an arm, both having long silver hair. [[Terrada]] quickly rushes over and everyone speaks to each other. "What did you do [[Oharah]]?!"
	- I SAVED HIM?!
	- YOU DAMNED HIM !!
	- HE'S ALIVE AND WELL
	- YOU'RE TURNING HIM INTO THE ANATHEMA. MOVE
		- [[Terrada]] commands him to move, commanding authority over [[Oharah]]
		- [[Terrada]] sprinkles the dust of [[Wahlen]]'s heart into his book
	- "[[Yakumo]]... Kill her"... Red haired man grabs [[Ikcho]]'s arm and kills them. Hair turns to steel, and attacks [[Yatari]]."

The [[Hideaway]] is under attack. We teleport in, the sky lights up in fire, [[Ikcho]] is attacking the [[Hideaway]]
- Likely [[Ganra Dokugan|Ganra]]'s forces
	[[Tsuchigomo]]

The top of [[Mount Tsuchigomo]] is exposed as a result of [[Ganra Dokugan|Ganra]]'s attack, exposing a [[Taor]] ruin
