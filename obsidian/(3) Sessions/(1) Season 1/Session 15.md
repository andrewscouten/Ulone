- Standing on the exact bridge in current time is the [[Ganra Dokugan|Tekina of Tsuchigomo]], slamming a fist into the wall as the bridge shakes
- A servant cowers, presenting [[Ganra Dokugan|Ganra]] a box... "Tell me who sent it, or you will get the same fate"... Apparently [[Ceol]] sent it.
	- "I let you run among with the rest of your rats and this is how I am repaid?! I will tear him apart. LEAVE. Or I will see you are crushed."
	- [[Ganra Dokugan|Ganra]] screams out in fury, slowly falling to his knees as he holds the side of the box. The box contains the remains of [[Kazera]].

[[Tsuga Kitakuri]] stands in front of us, a blade of glass stabbed into the ground. Ornately dressed in non-metal armor with 3 pistols on his hip...
- "I know why you are here..."
- "I'll turn 29 this fall. I'm a young man, second youngest to ever become a [[Samurai]]. I have a lot to learn. I have not seen the [[Great War]], been a servant under [[Timbatzu Azuna]], and I have not been the [[Yamakaen|Second Aikon of Fire]]. But I have never been a stupid man. So I question why you are here. Why you exist. Your kind aren't meant to be here. Perhaps your father hid you. But there is no chance that the [[Gintsuii]] don't know. You must be some sort of experiment. And I'm here to kill you. I don't know why you exist, but I don't need to. Behind this door is a truth that will shatter our world. A truth that we don't need. Please, I am giving you all a chance. Turn around. We can forget this happened. Lay low. Let the war pass. Live in peace. You'll hurt so many people if you uncover this truth. Please. Turn around."
- The [[Samurai]] have probably known this for 20 years, maybe more.

We make our way down, it seems to be completely cleared out.
- [[Tsuga Kitakuri]] is waiting for [[Hera]]... He wields a giant blade: "That's far enough."
- We see the resolve of a [[Samurai]], the face of someone that knows they now have to try... A face that [[Hera]] has not seen from her father. 
	- "I am [[Tsuga Kitakuri]], beast of [[Ikcho]]. Fall before the war god, fall before a beast!"

[[Tsuga Kitakuri]] draws his large Odachi... We almost all die...
- [[Hera]] stands up, blocking armageddon with black leaves and branches
- "8th leaf is faith, 9th is good luck... and the tenth... leaf feeds off of resolve... SHE'S A DEVIL"
- There's usually between 6-7 leaves on [[Levin]]

The door tries to stop us...
- "Danger. Cannot stop you. Turn back. Death"

We go further in... 
- We see a chair in the middle of a room, a giant crystal floating in the air. Someone is floating to the side with long white hair
	- This is [[Ikcho]], he disappeared 200 years ago. 
	- The person in the chair is 4 feet tall max... A dwarf? But the skin is so clung to their body, their skin clings to the ribs as if it's holding them together. This person hasn't eaten in a long time. They are dead, or at least appear to be
	- Then we see the lungs expand and slowly go back down.... On top of this figure's head is a crest of red hair. 
		- "My father. Hermit. Betrayer. [[Yori]]. [[Yori]]. [[Yori]]. [[Ceol]]. [[Ceol]]. [[Ceol]]."
- It is [[Ceol]]'s son, [[Yori]]... But... he saw him die?
	- Not a son. A Name. A number. A tool a product. A father. Not a father. Thing. Thing. Thing.. Apotheosis. Fate. Fate. Fate. Renewal. Past. Despair. Decay.
	- [[Ceol]] goes in to touch him... 
		- "THREAT LEVEL PRIMUS. THREAT."
	- "Powering up. 20%. 40%. Influx. Influx. Influx."
		- [[Ikcho]]'s eyes go dark and looks at [[Wahlen]]
		- [[Wahlen]] feels a stab wound in his side, as in his memories. "Creature. Darkness of the night."

[[Ikcho]]'s eyes start glowing, [[Yori]] is yanked upwards and constructs start to form in front of us. They are made of silver and gold energy.
- [[Macko]] rears back, firing water and constricting the prim guardian...
	- [[Ikcho]] sees this: "Brother?"
- [[Ceol]] my father. My Family. [[Yori]] the last tool. The last object. Father.
	- "I know not what you are. Hear me. Free me. I will take his place.

Porcelain figure of pure white light, face contours look humanoid, but it looks a little too perfect. What should be eyes are deep black spheres. It moves its hands up, splitting into 5 pieces. "Now, you will become one. One last time" Ceol smashes it, stopping it. Ikcho has been repelled. This treachery will not last.

[[Serai]] comes to save us. [[Akaza]] comes in, cloaked. I know you're there [[Velorah]]. 
- "Oh. you learned our name. What else have you learned. [[Ryu]]"
- You seek the power of [[Arutsua]], the power of the forgotten twins. If you want them, come through me.
- A dome of fire from [[Akaza]] encapsulates [[Velorah]]. I am ryu, I am the flames of destruction. The flames of life! [[Velorah]] enters [[Akaza]]'s chest, fire leaving and him vomiting blood.
