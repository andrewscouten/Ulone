Inside the [[Taor]] ruin at [[Ninnan Gate]]...
- 3 figures of the same height, another facing the group threateningly, one holds a sword
- Another image of one on the ground, and one stabbing a sword through them
- Looking up there are stars blinking... blinking in time with [[Wahlen]]'s heart beat... roots that are out of place coming down from the sides of the wall... roots of [[Levin]]
- Pedestal of 8 crystals on the ground with the [[Aikon]]s.. A voice says "assistance required"

	1 [[Tengu]]
	2 [[Ryu]]
	3 [[Orochi]]
	4 [[Namazu]]
	5 [[Yuki-onna]]
	6 [[Komyoryu]]
	7 [[Amanozako]]
	8 [[Tsuchigomo]]

[[Rui]] touches a beetle and sees a 3rd person POV of a large battlefield...
- 100s of bodies littered
- Sees 3 people with long silver hair, part dwarf, feline traits
- One of those people is [[Oharah]], kneeling and trying to stay awake
	- [[Oharah]] is the one that was attacked, and lost
	- [[Wahlen]] tries to save [[Oharah]] and gets stabbed by the poison dagger from his dreams
	- One of the felines screams and tries to help [[Wahlen]]... [[Akenai Sachio|Akenai]]
- [[Oharah]] consumes the souls of the dead... "Get out of my realm"

We all get onto a platform that the crystals unlocked... it starts to descend...
- "Threat level reassessed... majoris"
- Symbol of [[Tengu]], requires wind to open
- Combat! Big laser guy
- Symbol of [[Yuki-onna]]... not feline, but human-ish with horns

Threat level extremeus... Deploying [[Tsuchiga]]

[[Rui]] sees a mural...
- Black figure with 8 wings, each wing looks different. The figure has a light behind it, almost divine
- [[Wahlen]]
	- Black tufts of hair beneath the cloak, who are you, you, we...
	- Starts screaming, fights himself, accepts that he is the 2nd icon of fire... [[Yamakaen]]... the one who killed [[Akaza]]
	- Group has a heart to heart
	- Found a combination lock on the floor, similar to the one. when when we got imprisoned
