How was [[Ulone]] formed? Where did the gods come from? Who is [[Ulone]]? What’s [[Levin]]? All wonderful questions. Come, listen to a story passed from my mother’s mother and was even told before that. 

We don’t know much about what [[Ulone]] was before it was… well, [[Ulone]]. But we do know that it was a single continent and that [[Levin]] ruled over all of it. You and I were hardly twinkles in [[Levin]]’s great leaves when it started. It was said that the first races were that of [[Changelings]], [[Humans]], [[Dwarves]], [[Elves]], [[Gnomes]], [[Orcs]], and [[Yuan-Ti]]. For many years it was good. We had people harvesting the fields, making our mark, trading. I’m sure you’ve heard all the stories of where our heritage lies. But the damn [[Changelings]], [[Gnomes]], [[Elves]] and [[Orcs]]. It simply wasn’t good enough for them was it? They just had to ruin it all. Glad they’re gone. 

As I’m sure you know, those four began to root evil in our fulfilling lives. Wanting more and more. So that’s when [[Levin]] had to take the evil from their twisted existences. But even [[Levin]] couldn’t deal with those freak shows. So [[Levin]] had to create [[Tieflings]] to offset that. Funnily enough the [[Tieflings]] were worse than the others and after years of suffering their existence, they waged war on us. The other four abominations following them. During that time [[Levin]] did their best to help us, creating new races to aid our defense. I believe this lasted… four hundred years? Don’t remember, give or take a decade or so. Obviously it wasn’t all fighting over the years, that’s just what the spoken word has said. Thankfully we had an ally on our side appear, [[Zahl]], maestro of life and mistress of death. That had finally pushed the war in our favor, especially against the green skins.

During Ulone

// [[Lord Delivon]], head of [[Clan Delivon]], beginning inscription
//[[Samni]]’s main chambers, 199 AS, twentieth day of third Winter

Fifty years after [[Zahl]]’s appearance, [[Ulone]] was born. We know it was the first of Summer, the day has been debated for centuries so I won’t dare give my opinion. I’m sure the masses would tear me a new one. 

On the same day he was born, a new god appeared. [[Wiboe]], maiden of war and father of peace. Yet again another god on our side, yet the bastards didn’t relent. As [[Ulone]] grew up he was clearly shown to be a… unique man. He could lift boulders with a finger, wrestle a dragon, and even move mountains if he wanted. He was nothing less than a one man army and the war had never been easier. Then he just… disappeared one day. For about twenty years. The day he came back, two gods emerged with him. [[Kam-Zum]], Seamstress of Earth and lord of wind. Then [[Mondli]], the mistress of the sun and master of the moon. If you want my theory on what happened, I think he was fighting [[Yokai]] in their realm. No doubt the heretics were allied with him. I think that’s why he kept fighting for another year, maybe had some hope for them. Then I guess even the great [[Ulone]] couldn’t stand their disgraces any longer. So he separated a large portion of the land with his own hands and moved it away from the continent. Specifically the section with [[Levin]] on it as I’m sure you could deduce by [[Levin]] being here. Soon after he placed a barrier upon the land where none could get in. Now we’ve been safe for nearly three hundred years. We did have a few hundred heretics see the light of [[Levin]] before they left thankfully. But they’re gone now.

After Separation

After the continents separation, the birth of the [[Itanno]], the disappearance of the [[Elves]], the death of [[Ulone]], and the disappearance of the [[Itanno]], everything fell in line. I guess you could call it the first year of our age, what we mark as 1 AS. [[Ulone]] had three children. [[Samni, the Quick Witted Son|Samni]], [[Yatari, the Faithful Daughter|Yatari]], and [[Ikcho, the Daughter Who Could Craft the World Itself|Ikcho]]. As [[Ulone]] got older he could no longer manage an entire continent, so his children took over, one for each region.[[Samni, the Quick Witted Son]], he was always concerned with how the money flowed. [[Yatari, the Faithful Daughter]], always launching into religious fervor. And [[Ikcho, the Daughter Who Could Craft the World Itself]]. So each region was named after the leaders and we followed their will. Of course [[Ulone]] made the samurai which were the absolute authority above all else… other than [[Levin]] of course. The disappearance of every [[Elves|Elf]] was quite a shock, but not an unwelcome one. They were bringers of chaos, nothing more. The real shock was the death of [[Ulone]]. We hadn’t even considered he could die based on how great he was… but alas. That was a little under two hundred years ago. About a hundred years later, the [[Itanno]] disappeared. We’ve had man hunts for them for the past hundred years and we’ve found absolutely nothing. So we’ve done our best to maintain what they left us. Thankfully the [[Sea Ronin]] have been helping. [[Ikcho]] has been stronger than ever, [[Yatari]] is forever burning with religious fervor, and trade has never been more decadent here. But… with the rising dragons and some dragon cult, the increased, supposedly, yokai attacks, and potential sightings of Oni… I’m becoming worried. Shouldn’t you do something about that?
