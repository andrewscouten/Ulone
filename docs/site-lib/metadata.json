Enokaga had found that the royalists were holed up in a nearby fort last used in the Great War. After fighting through Royalist forces, they were corralled into a shrine to Levin where Kazera waited for them, she and Paragus had a small spat about him leaving Yatari. It came to a head with the two brawling and Paragus having the advantage before two summons overpowered him, leading to a swift defeat. Kazera then ordered her summons to kill the party and after a few moments they came out victorious. A very battered and heavily injured Paragus told them to stop Kazera as she had wings and could easily fly away with the second Tekina of fire. As they made their way to the rooftop of the fort, Kazera offered for them to be part of Yatari which the party quickly declined. A brutal fight ensued with many close calls, bountiful strokes of luck, and unrelenting will. But they had defeated the Tekina of wind. As Hera went to deliver the final blow, ribbons of green energy came from Kazera and went into Wahlen’s chest before spreading to each party member. The four fell to the ground in pain and screamed in agony before Wahlen heard a ‘there you are’. A memory then ensued for Wahlen where he was seemingly in a much more technologically advanced world on a ship with his friend Ohara Sachio. The memory ended with a black haired and well dressed man with an ethereal purple sword saying ‘I’m waiting, Wahlen’. As the group awoke, they all felt they had booms of power. As Kazera stood once again to kill them, her magic seemed to be gone. After being evacuated by Royal soldiers, they fled into the forest. Rui pursued and slaughtered the remaining guards with Kazera only being left. With a scream, a tempest raged around them forming a tornado as Tengu arose, blowing away Rui. As the group exited the fort, they saw the tempest raging and consuming the forest while Wahlen heard a calling from the tornado. After much disagreement, the group made their way into the tornado where only Wahlen, Paragus, and Macko saw a hooded man. As they continued, the hooded man stopped at a cliff's edge, Wahlen asked who he was, and what could be seen from him just smiled and fell off the cliff before Tengu attacked them.&nbsp;After another brutal fight, Wahlen took an opportunity to finish off Tengu, and after much wrangling and slashing, he had killed Tengu and was on a different floating island in the tornado. Moments later, Tengu rose again, no worse for wear as it was seemingly just playing with its prey. It began to squeeze Wahlen, cracking ribs and squeezing him to death. Wahlen’s last words were: ‘I will not let you stand in my way!’","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Completed","level":2,"id":"Completed_0"}],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"(2)-campaign/0-quests/(8)-inferno-in-the-night.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1764703373095,"modifiedTime":1769296082093,"sourceSize":2764,"sourcePath":"(2) Campaign/0-Quests/(8) Inferno in the Night.md","exportPath":"(2)-campaign/0-quests/(8)-inferno-in-the-night.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":53,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"(2)-campaign/0-quests/(9)-awaken....html":{"title":"(9) Awaken...","icon":"<span class=\"cm-iconize-icon\" aria-label=\"LiBook\" data-icon=\"LiBook\" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"display: inline-flex; transform: translateY(13%);\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"16px\" height=\"16px\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide-book\"><path d=\"M4 19.5v-15A2.5 2.5 0 0 1 6.5 2H19a1 1 0 0 1 1 1v18a1 1 0 0 1-1 1H6.5a1 1 0 0 1 0-5H20\"></path></svg></span>","description":"Fire surrounded Wahlen before a dome of fire erupted from him, blowing Tengu away.

Paragus transformed into the dragon of spring, electrocuting Yamakaen and knocking it unconscious. Wahlen was unconscious but alive and the group made their way back to the hideaway.

The samurai told them to stop while Hikari Seiji did not listen. A fight ensued where the Samurai, Lord Tsuga Kitakuri, helped the party defend Enokaga. After the fighting ceased, he told Hera he had a message from her father. His father asked Hera to return which Hera denied. The lord departed and they talked to Enokaga who informed them that the hooded man was seen making his way towards Samni with a companion. The party theorized that he was heading towards Ninnan gate with his companion. After convincing Yari to join them and Macko refusing to work with his brother's killer. The group set out and made their way to a small village where they were recognized by Hinatsuru Shuki, the lady of Samni.

After a tough fight, they proceeded to the final room where they saw a mural of a venerated humanoid figure with six wings. Two of a dragons, two of a birds, and two of a Heili dragons. There was also a combination lock with seven characters similar to the one the party saw while captured by the Kagenami. As Wahlen stared upon the mural, a massive headache formed followed by the world going greyscale and time seemingly stopping. Wahlen was then confronted with the hooded man and answered the question of ‘who are you?’ With ‘You. We are you.’&nbsp; The hooded man lowered his hood showing that he was an exact mirror image of Wahlen.&nbsp;Wahlen then went through a gauntlet of having to face who he was.

Trade is the main factor of the economy here and is often considered the richest region. It’s not uncommon to see common folk with silk clothing and having the pocket change to hire Sea Ronin. They hold almost every festival, big or small.&nbsp;Ikcho is often hailed as the land of creativity and is easily a hundred years ahead of every other region due to the creations they keep for themselves. They are responsible for almost every non rudimentary item or structure you see.&nbsp;Yatari is known as the region whose worship can be felt from miles away. They are undying to their gods and will use their religious fervor to harness magic. This is where most if not all shrine maidens come from. Some may call them fanatics to the missing Yatari or the gods themselves, but to claim they are ineffective in their ways is unfounded as you can see a shrine maiden in almost every town even outside Yatari.&nbsp;The largest mountain range in Ulone. It separates the land of leaves from the rest of the region. It’s mostly uninhabited other than non Heili dragons (Your standard European dragon), rumors of what should be long extinct Oni, and cult of the Helix dragons at the base.&nbsp;Named after the leaves that fall on the ground from the great Levin. Levin resides in the middle of this region and can even be seen over the whistling mountains. This is where the Samurai train fledglings and grant them their rights as rulers. Only the highest of nobility, and those who would become samurai are allowed to traverse on this golden land.&nbsp;While not necessarily a region itself, it is found in almost every region. The Taor are ancient ruins said to have existed before the war. No one knows who their inhabitants were, but some theorize they were much more advanced given that the stone that make these ruins have never been broken. Be that from human attempts and natural phenomena. Taor ruins are restricted to everyone other than the leaders of the region. Anyone else found trespassing will be given punishment.&nbsp;The name leaves no room for subtlety. They are crafters from Ikcho, often traveling to sell a new creation either of their own making, or an independent crafting organizations tool. Most are traders, but some are more than willing to pull out their tools and fight with them.&nbsp;Despite their name, not every shrine maiden is a woman. Shrine Maidens are worshippers of gods that tend to shrines of their chosen god. They often control the nature and elemental energies around them making them more than a shrine tender but also a guardian.&nbsp;The Sea Ronin are often warriors who didn’t make the cut for Samurai but are still more than capable monster hunters and bounty hunters. They get their name by their ability to control water and use it as a tool for battle. A sea ronin can be the warrior that saves your life, village, or more. For a price.&nbsp;The Samurai are the main bringers of law to the land. They are well known by their armor and the mask of a demon they have tamed around their waist that they use in full control. It is seen as rude or even heresy to not address one as ‘Lord’ or ‘Lady’ as they have been granted power by the great Levin themselves. A Samurai’s word is final, and if that fails, its blade is truly the finale.&nbsp;While not a true faction as they are recognized as a cult and are very small, the Helix dragons worship the Heili dragons and hunt the non divine dragons. Due to the dragons being a plague across the land, they take it upon themselves to kill it and feast on its flesh and bones. Some even claim that the more major parts of the dragon can alter their body giving them strange abilities. But they are all unfounded.&nbsp;<br>The pantheon consists of 5 gods, 4 of them having dual gendered depictions that represent a different domain.

Some of them are not races but rather a large generalized group.&nbsp;The most common species in Ulone, therefore most samurai and higher individuals are human. Overall they have a very neutral standing with people as they never did anything world changing in the war.&nbsp;The second most common race. However unlike humans they are often revered due to simply being the same race as Ulone. They might even get a pass for not addressing a samurai as ‘lord’ or ‘lady’.&nbsp;The last of the common races and have a general attracting aura around them. They are quick to make friends, possibly because their scales resemble that of the Heili dragon’s. But make no mistake, they were seen as one of, if not the greatest fighters in the war.&nbsp;The start of the less common races, half elves are spared persecution due to their ancestors switching sides in the Great War. But they are on a very thin line. It’s not uncommon for them to be refused service. Just penance for their ancestors' actions.&nbsp;One of the newer races, it is said that Levin took the holy parts of the Dwarves to create a new race fit. These are rather uncommon but often have kind souls and generally fit right in with Dwarves.&nbsp;Said to be an offshoot of the Yuan-Ti, Dragonborn are incredibly rare and are rumored to be fallen scales from the Heili dragons.

Buying a new bearer is commonplace, but the bearers who are able to fight cost quite a good amount.&nbsp;Attempting to remove their brand is punishable by death for the bearer and anyone involved.&nbsp;Similar to bearers, the Tekina are born magical but are given special privileges as it is said that the power of Ulone or one of his children flows through them.“And behold, eight wardens of my power. Fire, Earth, Water, Ice, Light, Darkness, Wind, and Lightning.” -Ulone, champion of LevinThe Tekina are often assumed to be warriors of great renown, some even being able to turn into large creatures known as ‘Aikons’. Some speculate that these Aikon’s are the Heili dragons, but they are only rumors.&nbsp;Current known Aikons:\nTengu: The breath of wind&nbsp;\nOrochi: The Lord of Lightning\nRyu: The Flying
