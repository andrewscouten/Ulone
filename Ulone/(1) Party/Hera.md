## Brand Beneath the Vey’l

[[Paragus Kou]] has once again hired [[Hera]] to escort the Kou family to a village known as Tansho. Kou has given little information as to why. As they arrived in Tansho, Hera was warned by a benevolent monstrosity, a Shokari, that Tansho spelled danger. Sure enough, a Vey’lflood had consumed the town and Paragus ordered her to go to Ninnan gate. One of the Shokari gave her a mount to travel with, allowing her to travel at a faster pace and meet with the party. 

After the events of Ninnan gate, Hera found herself captured with someone asking her questions which she did not cooperate with them. She then awoke to nearly being killed when Serai saved her. After meeting up with Paragus and his son, they found a samurai who just about killed Yari. Paragus, Barolt, and Serai stayed behind to buy time for Hera to escape the samurai. The last thing she told her was to meet Serai at their family home.
