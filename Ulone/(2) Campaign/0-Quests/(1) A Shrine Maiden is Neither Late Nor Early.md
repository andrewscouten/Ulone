## Completed 

The heir of [[House Talvec|Clan Talvec]], [[Yari Talvec]], has worries about the local [[Shrine Maidens|Shrine Maiden]] not appearing. The party has been hired to go investigate her whereabouts. After arriving at the shrine, the party was stopped by 3 men claiming they were members of a different [[Shrine Maidens|Shrine Maiden]]. After a fight, the party investigated the shrine, finding a small creature and a crazed shrine maiden named [[Lleth]]. The creature fled, slamming two talismans together, **one yellow and one green**. The party did the same with some they had found transporting them to a different realm where they spoke with [[Terrada|Terrada, King of the Yokai]]. The king claimed that the festival incident and what happened to the shrine maiden was due to another lord of the [[Yokai]], [[Oharah|Oharah Sachio]], launching attacks. They returned to the shrine with the small [[Yokai]] creature that was in service of the king named [[Gooma]] where the shrine maiden was healed. The king offered to have the party join his retinue to stop [[Oharah]], but they instead settled on working adjacent to each other and helping where they could.
