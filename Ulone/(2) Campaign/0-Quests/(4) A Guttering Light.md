## Complete

The last thing that was seen was the party being pulled out of rubble. The only thing left living at [[Ninnan Gate]] seemingly. 

Fading in and out of deep slumber and being fed berries that nourished them while also keeping them in said deep slumber, the party found themselves in shackles on a cart. In the brief moments they awoke, they realized they each were in a cell, still shackled, and being questioned. Over many loops of falling into a slumber, awaking in a haze, and being questioned, the loop had finally ended. A small group consisting of [[Yari Talvec]], [[Paragus Kou|Paragus]] and [[Barolt Kou]], [[Enokaga Aritomi]], and one other eluded to break [[Ceol]], [[Rui]], and [[Wahlen]] out. After mentioning that [[Hera]] was also there, [[Paragus Kou|Paragus]] and [[Barolt Kou|Barolt]] went to find her ordering the others to leave. As they did so, they discovered they were in a mass industrial factory in [[Ikcho]] known as [[Imugi Arcaneworks]]

As they continued on, alarm bells began to ring throughout the area and a [[Samurai]] tried to stop them. [[Yari Talvec|Yari]] told them to leave and the last the party saw of [[Yari Talvec|Yari]] was him against the [[Samurai]] in a very one sided battle not in his favor. 

The party finally reached their escape route which was an unfinished mining tunnel. They began to drive a large cart down the tunnel, the four fending off pursuers and eventually a large construct. Unable to stop the cart, it ran off an incomplete rail way, tumbling into rapids below.
