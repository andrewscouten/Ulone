Also known as the blades of [[Amanozako]], or ‘flawless blades’. After driving out the [[Hikari Seiji]], [[Yatari]] was put under their rule with the leader being [[Arasuda Tenbatsu]], Tekina of [[Amanozako]]. Under his rule, [[Yatari]] was turned into a [[Yokoku]] where one lord presides. Yatari now often practices experiments with the Suteki, which was once outlawed by the Samurai. After driving out the Hikari Seiji, they have been content since.
