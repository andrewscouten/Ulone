[[Serai]] and [[Hera]] catch up...

- [[Serai]] and [[Akaza]] found a combination lock. The code to it was "APOTHEOSIS". There is a note from [[Kaion the Chronicler]]:

- There were letters under [[Levin]]'s root. Putting them together, it spells [[Velorah]]
- The forgotten sun... twins... truth... flame
- Find the flame, find the one flame, find the blizzard of eternity, the light that burns, the anathema that scars, the one flame. False death that leads to the true death that eats them all to renew.

[[Akaza]] started talking about [[Levin]], that the branches reference something (points to?). Then he started rambling about theories about the [[Taor]]. [[Akaza]] doesn't think [[Levin]] is a god, that it's some sort of creature.
- Maybe [[Levin]] was the las surviving member of the [[Taor]]
- Maybe [[Ulone]] was a protector of the last [[Taor]]
- Maybe the people alive now are the "New Taor"
- We might be falling off track, and that's why [[Velorah]] is here... The new [[Ulone]]
	- [[Velorah]] doesn't have a physical form yet
- [[Akaza]] tried to find a way to seal [[Velorah]]... but they couldn't find anything of note...
	- [[Serai]] and [[Akaza]] were already on the way to the [[Taor]] ruin, on a quest to try to find means to seal [[Velorah]]. They found us there.
- [[Serai]] thinks [[Velorah]] *wants* something with us, but doesn't know what.

[[Serai]] lets us know of a town called [[Darga]], bordering between [[Samni]] and [[Ikcho]]...
- [[Ganra Dokugan|Ganra]] is there; he's still after us 
- Been trying to setup new recruits; the [[Kagenami]] are flocking there
- Kill him? See what he's up to?

Town called [[Horanma]] somewhere in [[Yatari]]
[[Serai]] and [[Akaza]] are on their way to the capital of [[Yatari]]
