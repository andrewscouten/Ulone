- Grief council [[Gyota]], face painted, monkey, rosy cheeks, blue hair... [[Wahlen]] goes in and gets traumatized... [[Rui]] goes in, the person has a different set of paint on their face... 
- A whole cart of 5 disappear, we see the bodies again in a cart... The bodies have the napes of the neck gone... We assume this is the work of a [[Yokai]]
