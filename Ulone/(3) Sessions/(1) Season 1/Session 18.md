On our way towards [[Taichun]], 2 day travel
- Some feat train time!
- We go over [[Paragus Kou|Paragus]]'s notes, a lot of it is word vomiting thoughts...
	- Suspects [[Imugi Arcaneworks|Arcaneworks]] is taking magic from the land
	- How to reverse [[Veil Lost]]; getting resistance to the [[Veil]]. Strong mages or [[Tekina]] are resistant to the [[Veil]]. If we take samples from them, they could be made into something that helps reverse it.
		- Blood doesn't work, skin samples don't work
		- What did work was skin grafting, as the body of the [[Veil Lost]] heals very rapidly. If something is put in the way, something can absorb it.
		- [[Wahlen]] makes a check: No [[Yokai]] has ever become [[Veil Lost]]. They are likely immune or resistant to a high degree

We arrive in [[Taichun]]
- People are walking around, shopping, and living life despite the war going on around them 
- [[Macko]]'s uncle is probably in one of the [[Shiki]]s.

[[Macko]], [[Rui]], and [[Hera]] go to see [[Macko]]'s uncle
- They see a lot of dead monsters as trophies hung on the wall
- A man with a cane walks in, similar to [[Akibara Shuki|Akibara]]. The cane has a firearm hammer on it, and in the other hand a large axe
	- "My nephew is dead, and you come in here impersonating him..."
	- [[Macko]] hands him the latter written by [[Hinatsuru Shuki]]
	- I am [[Natsu Shuki]], this is my blade [[Earthbreaker]]!
		- ([[Macko]] and [[Rui]] have an aside: "If things go wrong.... I think you could take him out")
	- [[Macko]] catches [[Natsu Shuki]] up; he seems disappointed he wasn't there
	- [[Natsu Shuki]] can't keep the bearers from the [[Hideaway]] for long, as he would require legal permits and people would question it. The [[Arcanum]] would start to crack down.
		- There are options...
			- Stay here in [[Samni]], probably being drafted to fight to [[Yatari]]
			- Get killed here
			- Going to [[Ikcho]] where they will likely be put into the [[Imugi Arcaneworks|Arcaneworks]] and die shortly
			- Climbing the [[Whistling Mountains]], likely dying
			- Going to [[Land of Leaves]], likely dying
	- "Do you intend to carry out the same mission of [[Paragus Kou|Paragus]]?"
	- There is a place a few dozen miles from there that we could take refuge in... It's in the middle of a lake, a ruin of [[Taor]] that has been long inactive. It was likely some sort of flotation vessel. It provides a good foundation for a base.... The only problem [[Natsu Shuki]] sees with it is that some parts of the land has been drained of life; the water here is tainted.
	- He will help us set it up, and in exchange...
		- Someone from the [[Arcanum]] keeps trying to buy a magical item from him. It's not really an unusual or rare item, but they are very adamant about buying it. The person goes by the name of [[Lord Ando]] (likely a false name), and they send various messengers. [[Natsu Shuki]] wants an escort into the [[Arcanum]], as he is not welcomed there. He found the object, a small pendant with no chain with a reddish green gem, in [[Yatari]].
