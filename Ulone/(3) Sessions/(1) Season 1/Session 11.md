We arrive at [[Lostwing]], a [[Taor]] ruin of a wing... The village is made around it...
- It should be bright like a candle, there is no light or people
- THEY TOOK other bearers to the [[Shiro Akuagan]]
	- Looking for a [[Tekina]] that is no longer here
	- 5 bearers imprisoned, one of which are [[Enokaga Aritomi|Enokaga]]

- We meet [[Kazera]] after the battle, where she summons something to fight us...
	- She offers us a job with [[Yatari]], if we worked for them, we'd work for [[Timbatzu Azuna]]
		- [[Hikari Seiji]] attacked [[Yatari]]
	- [[Paragus Kou]] and [[Kazera]] know each other
		- She used to be a very faithful woman, that's why [[Paragus Kou]] married her
		- He betrayed his country, a lord commander?
		- The emperor, [[Timbatzu Azuna]] whispered to people that he didn't think [[Levin]] was a god
		- Poisoned battalions that he was in command of
	- They found the [[Tekina]], they vanish

We rest after the fight, going to the fort tomorrow...
- Red cloak person was asking for the [[Ryu|Tekina of Fire]]

We approach the fort...
- Go in through a sewer 
- [[Yatari]] will be using the [[Tekina]] of fire...

We fight [[Kazera]]...
- The flames that consumed [[Ryu]] are not holy by nature 
	- [[Hera]] is hiding something

"There you are"
Reading letter
"Lord Takuta, as my advisor retires if you are my next top candidate... You will be the youngest inducted, [[Wahlen|Wahlen Takuta, Sigillite of Terada]], pure silver hair that goes to shoulders,

Reading letter of friend?
[[Lord Sachio]], tactical wit did bring doubt, but without it... it was highly unlikely that we would live. [[Oharah|Warmaster Oharah Sachio]]
- "I'm waiting [[Wahlen]]"
